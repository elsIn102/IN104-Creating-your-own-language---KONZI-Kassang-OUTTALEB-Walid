# IN104-Creating your own language : UF-C

Commands to compile the Lexer, Parser and Interpreter and generate the UF-C interpreter executable:
    -make UF-C
To interprete UF-C code, the code file has to be passed as an argument to UF-C (and has to have the .ufc extension).
For example:
    -./UF-C in.ufc


Here are a few examples of UF-C features in use:
    -Addition of floating numbers
    -While loop
    -If conditions

Followed by two algorithms:
    -Factorial of n
    -Fibonacci of n

//////////////////// ADDITION OF NUMBERS (float)

/*Definitions*/

z has an IQ of 0.0

F is starting their training with the smart x and the smart y to increase their IQ :
    x joins y and hits z
    z is thrown out
training is over

a has an IQ of 25.6
b has an IQ of 25.5
c has an IQ of 0.0

And the competition begins


/*Main*/

F punches c with a and b

the ring girl shows the wits of a
the ring girl shows " + "
the ring girl shows the wits of b
the ring girl shows " = "
the ring girl shows the wits of c

A time out is announced



/////////////////////// WHILE LOOP

/*Definitions*/

z has an IQ of 0.0
b has an IQ of 15.0

instructions is starting their training with noone to increase their effectiveness:
    b tosses away 1 and hits b
training is over

And the competition begins


/*Main*/

the ring girl shows "Before the loop, b = "
the ring girl shows the wits of b
A time out is announced

_ beats down b until they give up
meanwhile instructions enrolls noone

the ring girl shows "After the loop, b = "
the ring girl shows the wits of b
A time out is announced




///////////////////////////IF CONDITIONS

/*Definitions*/

z has an IQ of 0.0

a has an IQ of 25.0

c has an IQ of 1000.0

Add is starting their training with the smart x and the smart y to increase their IQ:
    x joins y and hits z
    z is thrown out
training is over

Sub is starting their training with the smart x and the smart y to increase their IQ:
    x tosses away y and hits z
    z is thrown out
training is over

Mult is starting their training with the smart x and the smart y to increase their IQ:
    x deals with y and hits z
    z is thrown out
training is over

And the competition begins


/*Main*/

A new tournament begins :
    -Match 1: a challenges b
    -Match 2: b challenges c
And the gambling den opens :
    -Add bets on 1 and 2 using a and b and gives the money to c
    -Sub bets on 2 using c and 24.0 and gives the money to c
    Finally Mult takes the rest of the bets using b and a and gives the money to c
The gambling den closes

the ring girl shows "z = "
the ring girl shows the wits of z
A time out is announced

the ring girl shows "c = "
the ring girl shows the wits of c
A time out is announced



//////////////////////////// FACTORIAL OF n

/*Definitions*/

n has this number of fans: 5


r has this number of fans: 1

Mult is starting their training with the famous x to increase their fame:
    r deals with x and hits r
    i joins 1 and hits i
training is over

i has this number of fans: 1

The competition begins


/*Main*/
n joins 1 and hits n

n beats down i until they come to an agreement
Meanwhile Mult enrolls i

n tosses away 1 and hits n

The ring girl shows the fans of n
The ring girl shows "! = "
the ring girl shows the fans of r
A time out is announced



//////////////////////////////// FIBONACCI OF n

/*Definitions*/

n has this number of fans: 16


a has this number of fans: 0
b has this number of fans: 1

temp has this number of fans: 0

Instruction is starting their training with the famous x to increase their fame:
    b hits temp
    a joins b and hits b
    temp hits a

    x joins 1 and hits x
    x is thrown out
training is over

i has this number of fans: 0

The competition begins


/*Main*/

n beats down i until they come to an agreement
Meanwhile Instruction punches i with i /*i = Instructions(i)*/
